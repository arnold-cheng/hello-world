Hello World,

My name is Arnold Cheng. I am currently a pharmacist, looking to make a career switch into programming. 
I am interested in Python, Java, and web development. I am also extremely interested in data science, big data, and machine learning. 

I am hoping this will kickstart my career into software development and data science!
